    "***2-1 Insertion sort on small arrays in merge sort***<br>\r\n",
    "Although merge sort runs in Θ(_n_ lg _n_) worst-case time and insertion sort runs in Θ(_n_<sup>2</sup>) worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort can make it fasterin practice for small problem sizes on many machines. Thus, it makes sense to ***coarsen*** the leaves of the recursion by using insertion sort within merge sort when subproblems become sufficiently small. Consider a modification to merge sort in which _n_/_k_ sublists of length _k_ are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard merging mechanism, where k is a value to be determined."
